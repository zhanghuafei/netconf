    Bug 8074 - actor name [test-device] is not unique!
    
    When creating a new actor with same name as an old one, it might fail
    becuase old actor might not be completely gone at this point.
    
    This creates a slaveActor which will never be closed, but instead
    every time that mountpoint is closed or master is changed, it would
    update NetconfNodeActor data and keep the same actor.
    
    Only time that actor is closed is when node was deleted. Or slave
    became a master
    
    The name of the actor is removed - letting akka to handle that -
    log the akka created name.

    Bug 8197: Deregister schema sources on actor stop
    
    NetconfNodeActor registers schema source provider
    to schema registry. When mountpoint is removed, this
    registration should be removed too. If it isn't,
    following issue can happen:
    
    1. Create mountpoint for device1
    2. Master actor for device1 is registered as mod-1.yang provider
    3. Delete device1
    4. Create mountpoint for device2
    5. Master actor for device2 is registered as mod-1.yang provider
    6. Register slave -
       schemaContextFactory.createSchemaContext(sourceIdentifiers)
       is called
    7. Since dead device1 master is still registered as provider,
       ask in ProxyYangTextSourceProvider timeouts
    8. After timeout device2 master is queried
    9. Device 2 slave mountpoint registered
    
    This delays slave mountpoint registration.

    Bug 8152: Transaction is already opened
    
    This issue happens, when for some reason transaction
    submit or cancel message isn't delivered to master
    node. With current implementation, only one device
    transaction can be opened at the time, so submit or
    cancel delivery failure will lock device forever.
    
    To prevent this, this patch introduces write trancaction
    idle timeout. Write transaction actor will be stopped
    and its device transaction cancelled, when no message
    is received for given time. Cancellation unlocks device,
    so mountpouint is usable again.

    Change handling of netconf cluster transactions
    
    Own actor is created on master for every transaction.
    Proxy transactions use this actor for mount point access.
    Creation of proxy transaction initiates sending of message
    to the master node actor. Master node actor starts
    transaciton actor if needed.
    Both master and slaves communicate with device via
    proxy transactions.
    
    For write transaction, submit and cancel cause actor stop.
    There can be single instance of read actor, which can be
    reused for all transactions.

    When posting data we are executing potentially a lot of reads,
    which can hurt if the backend is not residing on the node which
    is executing the operations.
    
    Fix this by issuing read requests in a batch and then collecting
    the results, which means we will amortize request latency.

    Migrate to karaf4 for the local karaf distribution
    
    Several folks have put in incredible effort to make karaf4 a reality in ODL.
    Kudos to those folks for this great effort.  This patch officially converts
    netconf's local karaf distribution to use odlparent's karaf4-parent artifact.
    
    The karaf4 implementation will still be accessible at the following well-known
    path:
    
    > karaf/target/assembly

    BUG-7868: perform checks before starting modifications
    
    The codepath for makeNormalPost() performs sub-optimal emulation
    of create().
    
    This patch changes the logic to first check for presence and then
    perform modifications. This saves cycles as continuous modify/read
    cycles incur heavy penalty on DataTree and also allows batching
    of modification requests.

    Bug 8095: Add operational devices to call home collection.
    
    Original call home feature has config presence but not operational.
    Operational devices are more convenient for monitoring
    populations of call home devices (and will be richer model
    in future).
    
    Change includes adding a call home status (connected, disconnected, ...)
    to operational devices.
    
    Address "functional" checkstyle issues. Turn on checkstyle to list all
    issues and fix all that have a non-cosmetic impact (unused imports,
    catching exceptions, ...).

    Fix LibraryModulesSchemasTest failure
    
    LibraryModulesSchemasTest#testCreateInvalidModulesEntries() tests
    filtering invalid modules entries during resolving
    ietf-netconf-yang-library/modules-state/modules node.
    
    Resolution goes as follows. We parse xml document containing
    ietf-netconf-yang-library/modules-state retrieved from the device with
    help of DomToNormalizedNodeParserFactory. Then we filter invalid modules
    entries from the parsed modules list node. Module entry is considered
    invalid if its revision or schema url are invalid.
    
    However, change in yangtools
    https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/53553 causes that parsing
    invalid revision will fail whole parsing xml process with unchecked
    exception.
    
    For now, do not test modules with bad revision. This is intended just as
    a temporary solution. We will also need to slightly change our
    ietf-netconf-yang-library/modules-state/modules node resolution logic.
    Opened BUG 8071 to track that.

    Handle shcema without namespace.
    
    currently when the ODL connects to a device and recieves a schema
    without a namespace it disconnects.
    This fix allows the ODL to ignore schemas without namespaces, but still
    maintains the connection and handles the rest of the schemas which do
    have a namespace.

    Option to receive only leaf nodes in websocket notifs
    
    Change for Bug-7718 in the netvirt project.
    
    The notifications sent over websockets contain the
    entire subtree, even if just one node changed. This is
    very inefficient for monitoring subtrees that may have
    large numbers of nodes. Point in case, we need to monitor
    changes to the port statuses under /neutron/ports/ but we
    do not want to have to IO and parse the entire list of
    ports for each change. This change proposes a new query
    parameter to the "data-change-event-subscription" REST call
    that specifies that the subscriber is only interested in
    receiving the leaf nodes that have changed. Each leaf node
    is (already) accompanied by its path.
    
    Here are examples of the notifications sent with the query
    param and without. The notification is generated by one of
    two port's status transitioning from DOWN to ACTIVE.
    
    Here it is without the query param. Note how all existing
    ports are sent. Note how the status is sent three times
    and the port twice (the notification send each level of the
    tree in it's entirety):

            "xmlns": "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0"
        }
    }
    
    Here is the same exact notification but generated with a registration
    using the new query param:
    {
        "notification": {
            "data-changed-notification": {
                "data-change-event": {
                    "data": {
                        "status": {
                            "content": "ACTIVE",
                            "xmlns": "urn:opendaylight:neutron"
                        }
                    },
                    "operation": "updated",
                    "path": "/neutron:neutron/neutron:ports/neutron:port[neutron:uuid='d6e6335d-9568-4949-aef1-4107e34c5f28']/neutron:status"
                },
                "xmlns": "urn:opendaylight:params:xml:ns:yang:controller:md:sal:remote"
            },
            "eventTime": "2017-02-22T02:27:32+02:00",
            "xmlns": "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0"
        }
    }
    
    Here is an example of the REST call with the new query param:
    curl -u admin:admin http://10.9.8.1:8181/restconf/streams/stream/data-change-event-subscription/neutron:neutron/neutron:ports/datastore=OPERATIONAL/scope=SUBTREE?odlLeafNodesOnly=true
    
    Also fixed the existing unit test and added one. However,
    there are some issues with jersey where sporadically the
    InputStream it passes in to read the post data is EoF.

    Eliminate ListenerConstants
    
    These constatns are used only in AbstractNotificationData, inline them
    in that class.
    
    lso convert to using Java 8 Time API to fix thread-safety issues with
    SimpleDateFormat. Since we need to choose an appropriate API, we choose
    to report instants in UTC, so we do not have a dependency on the concept
    of the local time zone.

    Bug 6645 - 2 digits milliseconds can not be parsed in notification eventTime
    
    Create a Parser and a Formater based of Java 8 DateTimeFormater API, using
    the ISO_DATE_TIME format, the UTC time-zone offset, and the local time-zone.
    
    As we're moving away from the pattern approach to parse/format those values,
    we have to handle the leap second corner case; it is possible to encounter
    time value being 23:59:60, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second.
    For that reason, if the parsing fails, we catch the exception and check whether
    the time has a leap second, and if it has, we replace the second-of-minute of
    60 with 59.

    Fix assumptions which are not in-line with API documentation,
    i.e. that getRevision() will return a magic string and never null.
    
    Once the users are fixed, getRevision() will return null as per
    its defined contract.

    BUG-7850: YangLibProvider needs to accept null revisions
    
    The API contract indicates that SourceIdentifier.getRevision()
    may legally return null. The implementation is currently broken,
    so make sure we account for both possibilities.
    
    Also share empty revision object for efficiency, as it is constant.

    Fix error reporting for PUT/POST
    
    If a datastore failure occurs for PUT or POST, restconf reports the
    error message "Problem while PUT operations" which is neither useful
    nor grammatically correct.
    
    It used to report the underlying error info however this was broken by
    https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/40235/ which changed the code to
    use a Future callback with a CountDownLatch but doesn't propagate errors
    from the Future. I don't understand why the code was changed in this manner
    when it worked fine and was much simpler using checkedGet. I changed the
    code back to use checkedGet, in several places.

    Bug 7295 - Incorrect handling of device transactions in clustered setting
    
    Transactions on mounted device in clustered setting are delegated to
    leader node and leader node actually configures the device.
    
    Implementation, hovewer, depens only on one transaction at a time.
    Delegated calls can interleave together, for example one node can submit
    transaction of the other node.
    
    Explicitly open a new tranasction before applying any operations to it.

    Clean ControllerContext up
    
    ControllerContext is supposed to be an immutable context, which has always
    a global instance, which is updated as needed.
    
    Current code mutates the context in an uncoordinated fashion, which means
    it can easily end up being inconsistent if a SchemaContext change occurs
    while a request is being executed.
    
    Add FIXME markers to issues to be solved in future and clean up various
    aspects of the file:
    - make sure the URI encoding charset is available
    - use lambdas wherever possible
    - fix keyword order to match JLS
    - trim long lines

    Close missing resources when netconf-topolgy goes down
    
    When the connection goes down, we are closing the NetconfDeviceCommunicator
    instance but we aren't closing the RemoteDeviceHandler. I believe this is an
    oversight, so implementing the Autocloseable interface in NetconfConnectorDTO
    that will close both the resources. The consumer of this DTO can then call #close()
    to release the resources.

    Bug 6637 - Make Netconf test-tool simulate buggy behavior
    
    Define new NetconfOperationServiceFactory which is used by testtool.
    This implementation intercepts RPCs and checks if their behavior
    is overriden by config. If it is, response defined in config file is
    returned. If it is not overriden, handling is delegated to the normal
    operation implementation.

    Bug 6903 - Implement Query parameters - fields
    
    - parse and verify fields parameter from URI
    - nodes written to output are limited in
    ParameterAwareNormalizedNodeWriter according to
    parsed fields parameter value
    - ParameterAwareNormalizedNodeWriter is used as writer
    even if no parameters are used
    - fields parameter is used together with depth
    parameter, when node is selected by fields parameter
    then value of depth parameter has no effect on selected
    node and its *ancestors*
    - contains unit tests for fields parameter parser and
    ParameterAwareNormalizedNodeWriter class
    - fixed depth for map nodes in way that when map node is
    target and depth is 1 no map entries children are written
    to output
    - added support to read data (GET) from restconf/data path

    Clear out tx reference immediately after submit.
    
    When sumbmitting multiple transactions after each other
    you could get into a state in which a transaction was submitted
    and the reference wasn't cleared out in the callback resulting in
    attempts to use an already finished transaction.

    Add blueprint wiring for netconf-client
    
    - move netconf-config-dispatcher to netconf-client because the *Module
    is creating a proxy that needs to share the same classpath as the netconf-client
    as it is the bundle providing its implementation and some of its classes
    aren't public, but either package-private or protected.
    
    - remove netconf-config-dispatcher from everywhere, but keep the models
    there for now as the USC project is dependent on them. To avoid having a flag
    day, we keep the models here until https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/46621/
    is merged. That patch will be eligible to be merged only once this current
    patch is merged.

    Bug 6679 - api explorer creates false examples
    
    Api explorer created false examples when yang has two data nodes with
    same name in different containers or lists. It compared name of data
    nodes rather than whole path to the data node which result to creting
    examples of same types even if they should be different.
    
    Fix examples by comparing the path to data node rather than just name
    of the node.

    - support for reading data on mount points
    - improved merge for config and state data:
    when identifiers for data in config and state are the same
    then merge must by done at one level down, otherwise state
    overrides config or vice versa
    - identiers are parsed to identifiers context with reference
    to mount points when data are behind mount point
    - adapted and added unit tests

    but parent mixin map node didn't exist, edit config failed.

    Move sal-remote to sal-rest-connector
    
    This module is only used by sal-rest-connnector bundle,
    moreover, it is intended to create notification stream
    and/or register a data change event which is done using
    RESTCONF, thus it make sense to move it to the appropriate
    project.
    I beleive this is a leftover of the migration that happened
    when controller was splitted out..

    BUG-5488: Decrease buffer size to prevent memory exhaustion
    
    When netconf device is connected using ssh, AsyncSshHandlerReader
    allocates buffer for each received notification. Under high load,
    it is possible, that notifications are received faster than consumed.
    In this case, pending notifications tasks are queued
    in netty executors queues. It could cause memory exhaustion.
    
    Preallocated buffer size was 8192 B. This patch decreases it to
    2048 B, as Apache Mina resizes buffer if it is needed.
    
    Bellow are test results of receiving 100000 notifications as described by
    https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/NETCONF:Testing#NETCONF_southbound_performance_test
    using the largest notification - i2rs-notifs-perf100k10prefixes.xml.
    
    Time needed to handle notifications is same regardless of BUFFER_SIZE value,
    but max memory needed is lower, if BUFFER_SIZE value is lower.
    
    BUFFER_SIZE = 128,  max heap memory = 1.1 GB  avg = 59640 ms
    BUFFER_SIZE = 2048, max heap memory = 1.3 GB  avg = 58450 ms
    BUFFER_SIZE = 8192, max heap memory = 2   GB  avg = 59207 ms

    BUG-865: Do not use QName.cachedReference()
    
    QName.intern() is the modernized method. Also use it for all constants,
    allowing greater reuse inside the JVM.
    
    Also create NodeIdentifier and LeafNode constants for things that are
    invariant, improving GC behavior.
    
    Finally import YangInstanceIdentifer.{NodeIdentifier,PathArg} to make
    the code more readable.

    Fix bug 5810, 5812:
    1. only when node's config statement is true, such apis as
    GET/PUT/POST/DELETE config are added for this node;
    2. when there are two or more top container/list nodes whose config
    statement is true in module, make sure that only one root post link is added for this module.

    Bug 5708: Schemaless netconf mount point
    
    Schemaless mount point can be used to connect to devices
    which doesn't provide their schemas. In that case,
    both rpc input and output must be of anyxml type.
    
    Data broker and transactions works with anyxml too. Read transaction path
    Yang instance identifier is transformed to xml filter structure
    used in get-config rpc. Resulting data are selected from rpc-reply
    according to path, wrapped in data element(to be able to return lists)
    and returned as anyxml. Write transaction path is transformed to
    xml structure. Data are appended to the last element of this structure.
    
    This is done by SchemalessRpcStructureTransformer. It is strategy
    used in NetconfBaseOps class. For standard mount points
    NetconfRpcStructureTransformer is used.

    Fix WebSocketServer allowed port range
    
    Operating systems generally limit binding to ports below 1024 to
    super users.  However, 1024 is fine for normal users.  This change
    augments the precondition check to allow for port 1024 if it is
    specified.

    Fix test failures in NetconfClientDispatcherModuleTest
    
    The implementations of NettyThreadgroupModule and NettyThreadgroupModule
    HashedWheelTimerModule in the controller were recently changed - they
    now obtain the service instance via the OSGi service registry therefore
    several BundleContext methods must be mocked appropriately.

    Bug 3863: Add onSessionStart and onSessionEnd notification support
    
    OnSessionStart and onSessionEnd support for md-sal netconf.
    MonitoringToMdSalWriter is notified about changes in netconf state,
    and writes this changes to datastore netconf-state tree.
    CapabilityChangeNotificationProducer listens for changes in
    netconf-state/capabilities subtree and publishesnotifications
    about changes.
    SessionNotificationProducer does the same for
    netconf-state/sessions/session subtree.

    Use mounted device schema context when resolving mounted device rpc path
    
    It wasn't possible to invoke rpcs on device, which were not present
    also in controller schema context, so only rpcs like get-schema and
    create-subscription worked. Now, device schema context is used to
    lookup rpc definition during parsing path, so rpcs defined by device works.

    Use keyed list as a selection node in filter
    
    Keyed list couldn't be used as selection node in filter
    before, because filter node was parsed to normalized nodes
    and yang codecs don't allow keyed list without key.
    Filter content is not transformed to normalized nodes now,
    only validated against schema context.

    Bug 5638 switch netconf to use odl-aaa-shiro isntead of odl-aaa-authn
    
    odl-aaa-authn has very limited uses now, since odl-aaa-shiro has
    included most of its features by default.  Switch netconf to use
    odl-aaa-shiro instead of odl-aaa-authn, to get most up to date
    aaa implementation.  odl-aaa-authn should be deprecated in a
    separate patch.

    Add support to RESTCONF to dynamically specify Filters
    
    This change builds of work that the AAA team took on to help add dynamicism to
    RESTCONF.  The javax.servlet-api specifies a means to define chains of Filter(s)
    in front of a web Servlet.  However, configuration of filters is not supported, and
    there is no easy existing mechanism to add Filters to a prebuilt ODL
    distribution.  The issue involves the fact that Jersey Servlets define Filter
    chains within web.xml, which is static and included inside of the odl-restconf
    bundle.  This makes it very hard (if not impossible due to lack of
    DynamicImport-Package declarations in restconf's pom) to alter the web.xml file
    after compilation.
    
    AAA added a filter called CustomFilterAdapter, which recreates the javax
    filter chain-of-responsibility pattern.  The dynamic filter chain functionality
    has very little to no overhead if left unused, but could be used to add
    Filter implementations that allow for enhanced logging of HTTP/S requests/
    replies, as well as other various functions.  This aids in debugging real
    world deployments, as well as enables enhanced Accounting and Auditing
    of the controller.
    
    This functionality has been raised as vital by members of the AG.

    Avoid relying on the timezone
    
    new Date(0) returns 1970-01-01 GMT, so running this test with a
    default timezone West of GMT fails (the YANG revision is 1969-12-31).
    Initialising the date using Calendar avoids this.

    Feature odl-netconf-client applies 01-netconf.xml config file,
    which expects capabilities provided by config file 00-netty.xml
    from odl-config-netty feature. But odl-config-netty is not part of
    odl-config-all feature, so it needs to be specified directly.
    
    Also, added more specific capability dependency to 01-netconf.xml
    and updated dependencies for netconf features pom.xml

    Bug 4100 - Extend sal-netconf-connector base schema context
    
    In case, that device supports notifications, but doesn't provide
    model for them, model from BaseSchema in NetconfMessageTransformer
    will be used as fallback.

    Bug 4577 Allow specification of a distinct schema cache directory per netconf device
    
    A leaf is added to odl-sal-netconf-connector-cfg.yang to allow specification of
    a schema cache directory relative to the "cache" directory.  The leaf defaults to
    "schema", so the default directory for loaded yang files is "cache/schema".  It
    is useful to specify a distinct cache directory per netconf mount to avoid potential
    model conflicts caused by revisionless import statements.

    Fix empty revision handling in NETCONF capability
    
    If a capability exposed by a netconf server contains revision parameter
    but has no value there e.g.
    <capability>some-namespace=some-module&amp;revision=</capability>
    
    connection would fail with NPE in netconf connector.

    Bug 4719 Shiro integration into restconf
    
    Switches from TokenAuthFilter, a ContainerRequestFilter, to AAAFilter, a
    javax.servlet.Filter.  This allows use of Shiro Realms including LDAP.  In
    order to run restconf without AAA, you can can still utilize the
    odl-restconf-noauth feature.  AAAFilter is disabled by default, and only
    enabled when the odl-shiro-act bundle is activated.

    Bug 3999: Create internal service to access restconf
    
    There are use cases for invoking restconf from internal code. However
    issuing an HTTP request is problematic as one would need to know the
    credentials and scheme (http or https).
    
    So I added a JSONRestconfService interface and implementation with CRUD
    methods that call the JSON readers/writers and RestconfImpl internally.
    The implementation is advertised as an OSGi service via the config
    system for consumption by clients.
    
    I only added a service for JSON - an XML service could be added as well
    later.

    Bug 3822: Improve error reporting for restconf PUT
    
    A runtime exception can be emitted by the netconf mount point which
    should be reported to the user, otherwise you get a 500 response with
    no error info which isn't very helpful.
    
    Also the fucntionality to output the error-info field was ommitted with
    the conversion from CompositeNode to NormalizedNode so I re-implemeneted
    it. It was originally ommitted with a TODO b/c the
    NormalizedNodeStreamWriters validate against the schema and error-info
    is defined as an empty container in the restconf yang. So there's no way
    to create a ContainerNode to represent the error-info data that conforms
    to the schema. To work around this, I created a leaf node and special-cased
    error-info in the stream writer to elide schema validation.
    
    I also added a regression unit test for the case where the URL contains
    an identityref.

    features-netconf-connector's POM inherits netconf-features-parent's
    version, 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT; but netconf-artifact's POM uses
    ${mdsal.version} for features-netconf-connector (1.3.0-SNAPSHOT).
    
    This patch uses ${project.version} instead, which is 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
    
    Without this sfc fails to build in a clean environment.

    Also fixes netconf-it module being configured to build twice. The root

    only one is needed.

    Bug 3017 - Error messages and logs missing for this or other RPC failures
    
    Note: Restconf doesn't contain logs for more functionality (not only RPC)
    so this patch adds better logging for Restconf (BrokerFacade and RestconfImpl).
    Administrators are not able to pair user's reports and karaf log without better
    logging information and it would help for better problem identify (e.g. bug 3080).
    
    * BrokerFacade - add Logging for lev info for all extra state
    * RestconfImpl - add Logging for lev warn for unexpected error state
                   - add Logging for lev debug for another extra state

    Fix deadlock in AsyncSshHandlerWriter
    
    Ssh window resize would call write twice, while a write pending was in progress
    causing a deadlock because the underlying channelSession was already locked.

    Fix intermittent ConfigPersisterTest failure
    
    testSuccessConflictingVersionException fails intermittently on Jenkins
    with different errors. I think the problem is that it sets up the
    "workingService" which the ConfigPusher is accessing createService on
    another thread. In reading Mockito FAQs, you may get strange intermittent
    results with multi-threading wrt to stubbing. Mocks can be accessed from
    multiple threads but it's recommended that you setup all the stubbed
    methods ahead of time. So I changed
    testSuccessConflictingVersionException to do so.
    
    After the fix, I ran the ConfigPersisterTest 550 times w/o failure.

    BUG-2838: Trim leading whitespaces from incoming NETCONF messages.
    
    Some network devices (such as Cisco routers) send RPC replies with a leading
    newline before the XML declaration. The OpenDaylight controller does not accept
    those replies: the XML parsing fails.
    
    This patch fixes the NETCONF messages before they are sent to the XML parser:
    it removes all the spurious characters at the beginning of the messages.

    Add {PHYS_ADDR} attribute to netconf stress client tool
    
    {PHYS_ADDR} is a wildcard and will be replaced by a physical address based on
    current edit indes. Suitable for testing edit-config performance with models
    containing physical address.

    Bug 2983: Added support for creation of multiple list entries
    
    JSON payload for POST allows user to specify multiple list
    entries to be created. This resulted in confusing behaviour
    where only one entry was allowed.
    
    Updated RESTCONF to allow multiple entry creation via POST
    for lists only.

    BUG-2877: Allow hello message with no namespace
    
    Several network equipments (such as Cisco routers) do not set the namespace
    attribute (xmlns) in their NETCONF messages. Whether this is valid or not is
    unclear according to RFC 6241 (NETCONF). This patch improves interoperability
    by relaxing the constraint for a namespace in NETCONF hello messages.

    BUG-2878: Add the XML declaration to every outgoing NETCONF message.
    
    Cisco routers expect that NETCONF messages are prefixed by the XML declaration
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>. Else, they close the NETCONF/SSH
    connection and log an error such as "NETCONF-ERROR: parse error before hello seen".
    
    This patch adds the XML declaration to every outgoing NETCONF message so that
    Cisco routers accept NETCONF messages coming from the OpenDaylight controller.
    
    This is a workaround for the sake of interoperability: according to RFC 6241,
    the XML declaration is optional so Cisco routers should accept NETCONF messages
    without XML declaration. See RFC 6241 section 3 "XML Considerations":
    
       A NETCONF message MAY begin with an XML declaration (see Section 2.8
       of [W3C.REC-xml-20001006]).

    Fix bug 2821 - restconf RPC parsing returns http status 500
    
    Note: RpcDefinition is a direct child of SchemaNode and we are not able to
    use it as DataSchemaNode or SchemaContext. In next RpcDefinition hasn't any
    child except Input & Output ContainerNodes. So we are using RpcDefinition
    for SchemaNode as a marker in InstanceIdentfierContext.
    
    * json input read @Provider has to change RpcDefinition SchemaNode
    to Input ContainerSchemaNode for a correct parsing RPC input data from stream
    
    * no-payload Rpc - Rpc Call could be without payload, but jersey always does
    to parse empty stream to NormalizedNode so we add check for stream.available
    before start parsing input NormalizedNode from stream and return NNContext
    with null data. All checks for data exist have to be implemented for every
    method with NormalizedNodeContext.
    
    * fix RpcOutput NormalzidNodeContext in RestconfImpl - we expect to have
    RpcDefinition as reultNodeSchema and data are payloaded inside as Output obj.
    
    * fix NormalizedNodeJsonBodyWriter and NormalizedNodeXmlBodyWriter for RpcDefinition
    - RpcDefinition has no child elements so RpcDefinition.output has to be a root
    DataSchemaNode for json parser
    
    * add JsonBodyReader/Writer test suite

    BUG 2805 - Fixed Restconf RPC calls and POST to create data
    
    RPCs now works again with JSON and XML
    POST works with data store.
    
    AbstractIdentifierAwareJaxRsProvider and its derivates,
    provides InstanceIdentifierContext as was parsed from
    RESTCONF URI, along with parsed NormalizedNode.
    
    If operation is create, then parsed NormalizedNode
    is used along with InstanceIdentifier context to compute
    full InstanceIdentifier for data to be created
    and works with these data.
    
    This actually simplified flow in codecs.

    Quickfix: Remove deprecated providers from Restconf Application
    
    Jersey 1.17 has problem with multiple Entity providers,
    which consumes same content-type and produces different
    Entity class. In wiring phase it does not report any problems,
    but in runtime it may select incorrect one, which
    will result in IllegalArgumentException, which is not
    reported.
    
    So in order to unblock most of functionality, legacy
    providers are disabled.
    
    This will fix data-store access, but without
    subsequent patches RPCs are not usable.

    CompositeNodes are wiped out from sal-netconf-connector.
    
    The inital operations performed on a remote netconf device
    (e.g. Schema download) is performed using a special schema
    context that contains base netconf, netconf monitoring
    and netconf notification schemas.
    
    With this schema context, it is possible to also use
    normalized nodes.
    
    YangInstanceIdentifier -> NormalizedNode filter structure
    is handled by a class named InstanceIdToFilter that was
    extracted from deprecated DataNormalizer.

    Add SchemaContext to NormalizedNode parser in RESTCONF
    
    Correct parsing of identities, instance-identifiers
    and others, requires access to full SchemaContext,
    not only subset of it.
    
    Migrated to parser factory, which provides that
    access in order to correctly deserialize
    context-sensitive types.

    Fix race condition in get/get-config netconf rpcs for config subsystem
    
    The read and transformation of modules from config subsystem is performed in a couple of steps. Each step queried the config subsystem on its own so it was possible to cause inconsistencies among these steps if get/get-config was executed while another transaction was being committed. This race condition, if hit, caused the rpcs to fail with an exception of a missing MBean.
    
    After recent introduction of "optional reconnect after capability changed" feature into sal-netconf-connector, this race condition caused get rpc invoked by the connector to fail.
    Scenario:
    odl-netconf-connector-all is installed,
    after the loopback is connected any other feature with configuration is installed e.g. odl-restconf-all,
    loopback connector reconnects and as it comes back executes get rpc (to query ietf-netconf-monitoring)
    get rpc in config-netconf-connector fails to transform the modules into xml due to mentioned race condition as the initial config file for restconf has been pushed
    
    Now the get/get-config read the data from a dedicated transaction started just for the read.
    Note: get rpc reads the runtime beans that are part of no transaction, so there is still possibility for this race condition regarding runtime beans.

    BUG-2633 - Netconf northbound mapping.
    
    Supported operations for now are:
    get, get-config - candidate and running datastore, without filtering
    edit-config - only on candidate datastore
    discard-changes
    lock, unlock - supported only for compatibility reasons since we don't support locking of running datastore, and each session has it's own candidate datastore.

    BUG-2633 - Added Operation Service Factory Filtering for Netconf.
    
    Since getting services is done by class name, we needed to add additional filtering by
    name to not get controller subsystem netconf operations mixed up with md-sal northbound.

    From method findModule() of RestconfImpl was removed original exception
    because the case when data == null can't (before every call of findModule
    is checked whether data != null)
    
    New exception was added because just after calling of findModule() method

    BUG-2560 Canonical write to remote netconf devices
    
    Current sequence for writing to remote netconf devices:
    
    Writable running only:
    - lock running or fail
    - edit running (unlock on fail)
    - unlock running
    
    Candidate only:
    - lock candidate
    -- if lock fails, try to discard changes
    --- if discard fails, fail
    --- if discard succeeds, lock candidate
    ---- if lock fails, fail
    - edit candidate (discard-changes + unlock on fail)
    - commit
    - unlock candidate
    
    Both writable running and candidate:
    - lock running or fail
    - SAME AS FOR CANDIDATE ONLY
    - unlock running

    BUG-2459: reuse EXI Reader
    
    The reader performs an internal reset on each invocation of parse(), so
    it can be freely reused as long as we guarantee there are no concurrent
    invocations. Our decoder class is not Shared, so netty guarantees this.

    EXI Transmogrifier performs an internal reset whenever we acquire the
    SAXTransmogrifier. This means that we are free to reuse the instance
    between individual invocations as long as we can guarantee there are no
    concurrent access. That is guaranteed by our Handler not being Shared.

    BUG-2459: use thread-local cache of transformers
    
    As it turns out, we can reuse transformers in the encode path. Do
    precisely that, keeping them in thread-local variables. This is safe in
    context of Netty, as we are invoked only from the netty threadpool. This
    has the benefit of reusing the transformers across all sessions
    associated with the threadpool.

    BUG-2475: Do not issue garbage collection on when pushing configurations
    
    This gc() call used to make sense when we were running this code as a
    one-shot initialization (e.g. Hydrogen container). With the Karaf
    changes, this was moved into a persistent codepath -- which does not
    make sense at all.

    BUG-2459: do not convert NetconfMessage
    
    Router's onNetconfMessage shows up as a hotspot in performance traces,
    which turns out to be another case of coversion of XML document to a
    string just for debugging/error handling purposes.
    
    In case of a debug + error we are taking the hit of one toString()
    operation, but that should be fine. We make that up by being smarter
    about creating maps in the error path.

    Handle more specific BindException and IOException
    
    It is good pratice to handle specific exceptions rather than using the
    catch all generic Exception.
    
    This code change handles the java.net.BindException such that if an port
    is already in use we skip creating the simulated device on that port.
    
    IOException will display the failure message and exception and not cause
    additional attempts.

    If input value for leaf in JSON format contained opending angle bracket
    (<) followed by collon (:) then exception was raised.
    
    Because schema isn't present at time of JSON input reading it was also
    supposed that data could be of type leafref which is specified in format
    module:value. Module part is then transformed to instance of URI object.
    
    Chracter < isn't permitted in URI according RFC2396 for URI and while
    creating instance of URI class the exception which wasn't caught was
    raised and transformed to returning error message.

    * To break the cyclic dependency, this patch temporarily stops running

[33mcommit c1e5d955f99c29eadf6dabdd5219b22cd99d045b[m
Author: Ed Warnicke <eaw@cisco.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 27 16:09:18 2014 -0500

    Initial clustering feature
    
    Besides the clustering feature changes a couple of other changes
    had to be made to the distributed data store and remote rpc modules
    to make the solution work with karaf
    
    1. The akka.conf in sal-clustering-config has now been changed so that
    it works in a single node cluster out of the box. Specifically the hostnames
    have been set to 127.0.0.1 and the member role has been set to member-1
    
    2. The distributed-data-store and the remote-rpcconnector now load akka
    configuration from the configuration/initial folder. The positive thing about
    this is that even in a multi-node cluster one does not need to pass the location
    of akka.conf on the command line. The negative thing about this is that you
    cannot change the location from which the akka configuration can be picked up.
    Though this should be ok because we specifically pick modules.conf and
    module-shards.conf from the configuration/initial folder as well.
    
    3. The Protobuf bundle has now been wrapped and a Dynamic Import has been
    added to it so that it can deserialized specific protocol buffer messages
    
    4. The RestConfProvider was not written to shutdown correctly. While this is
    not normally an issue it does become an issue when the clustering feature is
    loaded for the first time because in that case the RestConfProvider may need
    to be shutdown by the config sub-system

    Added basic restconf statistics which counts
    incoming requests and exported it via Config subsystem.
    
    Export via config subsystem provides this
    statistics via JMX and Netconf. In distribution, where
    sal-netconf-connector is present and 99-sal-netconf-connector.xml is enabled,
    Restconf statistics are also available via

    BUG-1442: integrate XML/JSON Normalized Node writers with Restconf
    
    Integrated XML and JSON NormalizedNodeWriters for returning
    data from Restconf. This writers does stream processing
    and writes data into input stream without any intermediate
    representations.
    
    This will help with larger data sets, since it theoretically
    reduces memory footprint of reading data from MD-SAL.

    BUG-1541 Netconf device simulating testtool
    
    Produces executable jar file.
    
    The jar can simulate arbitrary number of netconf devices that listen on configured ports
    Schemas are loaded from a provided folder
    Can also generate ODL initial config files for started simulated devices to support testing with ODL distribution

    Bug 1503: RestconfError "data-missing" is error code 404.
    
    The base specification listed the error code to be 409, which is in
    direct violation on HTTP. The restconf specification will be fixed in
    the upcoming draft, meanwhile we are going for the new, sane behavior
    regardless.

    Add exists method on DOMStoreReadTransaction and DOMDataReadTransaction
    
    Introducing this API does not impact clients as it is mostly internal.
    
    One reason for adding this API is because of ensureParentsByMerge used in a couple of places
    which keeps checking if a parent node exists by reading a node to figure out if it exists. This is
    fine for the InMemoryDataStore but it can be terrible in a distributed data store where the shard
    which contains the data is remote. All sorts of overhead is associated with a remote read including
    serialization which can actually be pretty expensive.

    Missing nodes in datastore are created before storing payload data.
    2) InstanceIdentifier is now correctly created via

    ControllerContext.dataNodeChildByQName method refactoring
    
    ControllerContext.dataNodeChildByQName() is used only in childByQName()
    methods with DataNodeContainer input parameters:
    - ContainerSchemaNode
    - ListSchemaNode
    - Module
    Therefore child node of these DataNodeContainers can't be ChoiceCaseNode
    (because it can be only child node of ChoiceNode)
    and original branch >if (node instanceof ChoiceCaseNode)< couldn't be
    executed.
    I think that it was typo.

    Optimize RESTCONF module/node parsing
    
    Profiling has shown that the current implementations are still not upto
    par with what they should be: 189 invocations of the two consumed 64ms,
    with most of the time being spent splitting and iterating.
    
    Given that the parsing operation is really simple, we can do much better
    using String.indexOf() and String.substring().

    BUG-1384: YangStoreServiceImpl.refresh() should never block
    
    As descirbed in the bug, we are seeing large amounts of contention on
    the monitor when calling refresh(). Rework the safety such that the
    refresh path does not block and perform checking for refresh in the
    get() path, which is forced to retry should a refresh occur.
    
    With this patch reported contention disappears completely and startup
    time is improved by about 8 seconds on stock SP edition.

    Bug 1239 - Clean up and refactor netconf-ssh client
    
    Remove commented and dead code in netconf-netty-util.
    Move SshHandler to client package in order to make it package private.
    Wrap OutputStream in SSHClientHandler with a buffer.
    Remove VirtualSocketException as it was a workaround for
    passing context without checking whether session was established.

    Deprecated Rpcs and RpcErrors helper classes
    
    With the new RpcResultBuilder class, we can deprecate the Rpcs and
    RpcErrors classes.
    
    Also migrate all uses of the deprecated classes to RpcResultBuilder in
    the controller code.

    Introducing simple merge strategy for config subsystem
    
    MergeEditStrategy wasn't really merging.
    Now it is, but only for ObjectName[].
    However, since ObjectName[] is 90% of the interesting
    cases, this should get us a long way.
    
    This is needed to be able to handle reasonably
    extension, with the ability to wire in multiple
    extension modules independently, as we need to do
    for things like OF extension.

    Container schema node + multiple data nodes ->
     exception RestconfDocumentedException is raised.
    List schema node + one data node (e. g. in json is specified as container
    "list-name":{} and not "list-name":[{},{}...,{}] -> this is acceptable case because
    list can have even only one entry.
    Leaf schema node + multiple data nodes -> special check whether at
    equal objects is everytime uniqe key. If it isn't so then
    RestconfDocumentedException is raised. For Json specific JsonParser was
    implemented which is catch duplicity at object level an time of parsing.
    For XML this duplicity name check is done during normalization phase.

    Here we do not cache the transformer, as we are called from datastore
    thread, which has essentially no business in this. Same goes for
    DocumentBuilderFactory.
    
    Also, the transformation to RFC3339 timestamp was compiling the same

    As a futher optimization, we also create a thread-local cache for

    Bug 977: Return RpcError result on neconf failure
    
    NetconfDocumentedException:
       - Added methods to convert to and from XML.
    
    NetconfMessageTransformUtil:
       - Added code to convert a NetconfDocumentedException to an RpcError.
       - Modified checkSuccessReply and checkValidReply to throw
         NetconfDocumentedException instead of IllegalStateException.
    
    NetconfDeviceCommunicator:
       - Modified processMessage to return an RpcError result for invalid
         message and netconf error reply.
       - Modified other places that previously returned an exception in the
         Future to intsead return an RpcError result.
       - Improved  synchronization by removing synchronized from method sigs
         and locking only the code that needs it.
    
    SendErrorExceptionUtil:
       - Modified createDocument to call
         NetconfDocumentedException.toXMLDocument
    
    XmlNetconfConstants:
       - Moved to netconf-api so NetconfDocumentedException could access it.
    
    The rest of the changed files were to change the import for
    XmlNetconfConstants.

    Bug 931, Bug 910 - Enhance Restconf Swagger Documentation
    
        1) We now generate different data models for config and operation data stores
        2) We no longer generate URLs for leaf nodes since RESTConf doesn't support those
        3) We now expose our mount points in our system in a list, which a user can select and view the list of mounted resources
        4) Cleaned up non-ODL branding, adding in ODL branding.
    
        To test
        A) Add a device which has mounts in your system (consider ping 2.0 https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Ping_2.0_-_Discover_and_Model_Plugin or a netconf device)
        B) Navigate to http://localhost:8080/apidoc/explorer)
    
    Patch Set 2: Original Change
    Patch Set 3: Rebased, remformmated existing code which used 2 spaces instead of 4
    Patch Set 4: Kicking off a second build, since I got mixed build messages.

    Bug 225 - added support for depth RESTCONF parameter in URI
    
    Modified RestconfImpl to prune the resulting ComositeNode tree
    based on the depth parameter, if specified.
    
    A depth of 1 retrieves just the target resource and no children. This is
    a way to determine if the resource exists. A depth of 2 retrieves the
    target resource and just its direct children - any child container would
    be empty.

    Bug 951 - Externalize cors definition of restconf
    
    Create new project called filter-valve that allows defining filters
    outside of web.xml. An xml file is added to configuration folder
    of distribution.
    
    The valve allows any kind of filters to be applied around each
    request, mapping contexts and path pattern same way as servlet
    specification does. The xml file allows defining filter templates,
    each context (WAB) can reuse and modify the common configuration.
    
    Currently only restconf has externalized cors filter definition.

    BUG-1105: Implement subtree filtering in netconf
    
    Implement subtree filtering according to RFC 6241 section 6.
    Current implementation first gathers response XML, then
    applies filtering. Since netconf server is pluggable,
    modules that might consume significant amount of time
    to build their response can read the filter and optimize
    their result. Even if modules do not support filtering,
    their result is filtered by SubtreeFilter right before
    sending out the aggregated response.

    BUG-981: Fix XML serialization test
    
    Since commit 7624eedc495e85d12c2c2c56efb09dfd9406f977 changed XML
    resolution rules such that XML namespace is required to properly
    identify a node.
    
    This broke serialization tests, which did not provide module/revision
    identification -- which meant serialized data was being handled by
    String encoder. The string encoder does not do the right thing for
    arrays -- which broke the bits and binary encoding tests.
    
    Fix the tests to specify module/revision, thus matching conforming to
    schema.

    Bug 762: Fix sal-rest-connector unit tests
    
    The cnsn-to-json/simple-data-types/xml/data.xml test file used by
    CnSnToJsonBasicDataTypesTest actually contains some invalid union type data.
    The tests currently pass because union type input data isn't currently
    validated. Patch https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/7367/
    in yangtools adds validation so the unit tests must be fixed before
    that patch is merged.
    
    In addition, the yangtools patch changes some static fields in
    TypeDefinitionAwareCodec to private which breaks compilation of
    CnSnToXmlTest. This patch modifies CnSnToXmlTest to not use the static
    fields.

    BUG 624 - Make netconf TCP port optional.
    
    Previously netconf-impl opened a TCP port with no authentication on
    localhost, and netconf-ssh used it as a bridge to forward trafic
    after processing authentication and encryption.
    
    This patch creates new project netconf-tcp and modifies netconf-impl
    to open the netconf server on LocalAddress. Both tcp and ssh modules
    now communicate with this local server.
    Config ini is modified so that the TCP port (8383) is not enabled
    by default.

    Bug 1010: Implement restconf error responses
    
    - RestconfError (new): encapsulates error information as defined in the
      RESTCON RFC.
    
    - RestconfDocumentedException (new): exception that wraps RestconError info.
    
    - RestconfDocumentedExceptionMapper (new): JAX-RS ExceptionMapper that
      translates a RestconfDocumentedException appropriately to XML or
      JSON depending on the user's mime type.
    
    - JsonMapper: modified to handle null child schema as restconf error-info
      is defined as 'anyxml' and thus no schema may be present.
    
    - ControllerContext: added getRestconfModuleErrorsSchemaNode method to
      obtain the 'errors' container schema from the ietf-restconf module.
    
    - Removed ResponseException and changed occurrences in various classes that
      threw ResponseException to throw RestconfDocumentedException instead.
    
    - Added unit tests for new classes and modified existing ones
      accordingly.

    Bug 1003: Restconf - remove whitespace on input
    
    JsonReader, XmlReader:
       - Trimmed whitespace on leaf data input
    
    AbsractRpcExecutor, BrokerRpcExecutor, MountPointRpcExecutor:
       - Modified to handle IllegalArgumentEx and UnsupportedOperationEx
         thrown from invokeRpc to throw appropriate ResconfDocumentedEx.
    
    ResconfDocumentedExeptionMapper, RestconfError, RestconfErrorTest:
       - I discovered that the Response.Status.NOT_IMPLEMENTED jaxrs enum
         is defined in the enum class that is used at compile time but
         isn't defined in the run time enum class provided by jersey.
         So I changed RestconfError.ErrorTag to store the integer status
         code (501) instead of the enum. Ideally compile and run time
         should use the same lib.
    
    - SchemaAwareRpcBroker:
       - Modified to throw UnsupportedOperationEx if no RPC impl is found
         so the restconf front-end can yield the appropriate
         501 (Not Implemented) status code.

    Bug 1036 - Allow using container in case stmt to preserve uniqueness.
    
    Modify yang-jmx-generator and config-netconf-connector to allow adding
    dummy container node.
    This allows declaring multiple config modules with same attributes within
    single yang module.

    Bug 992 - Fix broken netconf xml serialization.
    
    Empty commit and restart triggered xml deserialization errors
    in netconf. The problem is in type and name elements - they
    should not be prefixed with 'prefix:'.
    
    This fix triggers other bugs in md-sal modules, tracked
    as dependencies of this bug. To test proper (de)serialization
    with this fix, 01-netconf-connector.xml and 02-clustering.xml
    must be delted.

    Bug 953 - Enable mounted RPC calls via RestConf
    
    Modify RestconfImpl to allow RPC calls via mount points.
    ===
    MountPointImpl - wired pass through call for invokeRpc that was missing.
    RestconfImpl - abstract the execution of RPC out to an "RpcExecutor" class.
    Remaining classes - added tests to cover new code, including the toaster.yang file (modified from original) to test various RPC calls.
    
    - Patch Set 8 - fixed unit tests which were failing (one failure due to missing future enhancement, another due to missing test rpc in yang file).
    - Patch Set 10 - fixed run failure by addressing package import.
    - Patch Set 13 - Cleaned up exception throws / used Preconditions checking.
    - Patch Set 14 - Rebased
    - Patch Set 15 - Added back change that was accidently removed during merge / rebase.

    Trigger a GC once initial configuration has been pushed
    
    This introduces a single run of GC once we complete the initial
    configuration.
    
    The reasoning behind that is that we generate a fair amount of metadata
    which we are likely to retain unmodified for extended periods of time.
    We take care to store it in both memory and CPU efficient format, which
    unfortunately requires us to do some copying around to compact it,
    leaving a sizeable chunk of garbage on the heap.

        Fixed miscellaneous errors on shutdown:
            -  FlowProvider, GroupProvider and MeterProvider: all throw an
               UnsupportedOperationEx from their close methods with a TODO message.
               Implemented close to close the commitHandlerRegistration.
    
            - NetconfSSHServer: logs a socket closed exception due to closing the socket
              on shutdown. We can ignore this and not log the error (if 'up' is false).
    
            - RestconfProvider: NPE in stop method calling session.close.
              The 'session' member is never initialized or otherwise used so removed it.
    
            - RuntimeMappingModule and SchemaServiceImplSingletonModule:
              IllegalStateException from bundleContext.ungetService() call because the
              bundle has already been shutdown. Ignore ex as this can occur
              normally.

    Skip from the surefire execution plugins that can step over guava feet
    
    Seems like the com.google.common.collect.* package has been reused in
    several jars like:
    
    - guava
    - google-collection
    - pax-url-aether
    
    Now the netconf-it in the classpath of contains via transitive the 3
    of them but only guava is usable by yang-bindings used by the netconf
    client test. The presence of the 3 cause unreliability on the test
    pass based on who comes first in the classpath of surefire. The fix is
    to make sure surefire ignore the other two libraries except guava.

    BUG-848 Fix netconf communication while using CHUNK encoding
    
    Cause:
    When using Chunk encoding, the negotiation process lasts longer due to pipeline manipulation.
    Messages received while still in negotiation were not processed correctly (This is incorrect, messages should not be processed while still in negotiation).
    
    Fix:
    Introduce a message barrier that will forward only hello message until negotiation is completed (implemented in NetconfXmlToHelloMessageDecoder).
    Modify SessionNegotiators to replace message barier/hello decoder when negotiation is finished and to process non-hello messages stopped by the barier.
    
    * Exclude pax-url-aether dependency in netconf-it

    BUG 652 leafref CCE & BUG 720 colons problem
    
    BUG 652 leafref Class cast exception
    By default if input data were in format which was possible to parse as
    XPath if was done like this. It caused that for leafref which indexed to
    instance-identifier the value was parsed as XPath and not as string.
    
    BUG 720 colons problem in JSON
    If input string contained colon (:) then it was dealed as namespace:value
    and object of type IdentityValuesDTO was created (it is probable that
    data could be of type identityref). If data wasn't of type leafref then it
    was incorrectly processed as leafref.
    The RestCodec was updated to correctly translate data (cases when data
    contains ':' but aren't of type leafref)

    Adding auto-sorting plugin to all Controller via parent/pom.xml
    
    leveraging google's sortpom plugin, all controller poms are sorted
    at build time as per the opendaylight/commons/parent/pom.xml configuration.
    
    Sorted lists of properties, dependencies, and plugins will increase pom readability
    and help prevent duplicate entry errors.
    
    This first submission is huge as I changed one pom.xml and all are then sorted.
    Only if the sortpom plugin is reconfigured will all pom's again be changed.
    
    Note that if any pom.xml is pushed without having been through a build ... folks are
    going to see pom.xml files showup as modified unintentionally.

    Resolve Bug:713 - Open snapshot only once per session.
    
    Rework NetconfOperationServiceSnapshot lifecycle: Open it when
    session negotiator is requested, thus at entry point where both
    hello message and session listener is created. Close the snapshot
    when NetconfSessionListener receives down/terminated event.

    Resolve Bug:707 - ConfigPusher should wait for netconf-impl to register JMX bean.
    
    Fixes race condition that was observed in ITs, where config pusher started pushing
    empty configuration and immediately registered itself as notification listener of
    a JMX bean that was not yet present. Fix waits both for netconf-impl and
    config-netconf-connector services so that both dependencies are activated before
    pushing of configuration can occur.

    Bug 651 - Added back IDE profile and changed target for yang sources
    
    - The IDE maven profile was added back based on feedback from Giovanni Meo
    
    - To avoid devs from having to run the IDE profile so eclipse can see the yang
    generated source files, the yang source files are now generated under src/main/yang-gen-sals
    or src/main/yang-gen-config instead of target/target-ide.
    
    - The maven-clean-plugin was moved to the commons base pom and removed from
    all child poms where it was specified. Thus, it will be automatically run for all
    projects. The plugin's execution will clean all xtend and yang generated source dirs.
    
    - The build-helper-maven-plugin was also moved to the commons base pom and removed from
    all child poms. It will automatically run for all projects and no longer needs to be
    specified in child poms. The plugin's execution will created eclipse source folders
    for all xtend and yang generated source.
    
    Tom P and Devin A really did all this work, Greg just gets credit unfairly.

    524 bug - %2F slashes translation behind mount point (unit test)
    
    New test getDataWithSlashesBehindMountPoint() tests whether URI identifier
    which contains slashes encoded as %2F (e.g. in key part of URI) is translated to identifier with simple slash
    characters (/).
    
    It is checked whether InstanceIdentifier instance is created with simple
    slashes. The instance is then used as input parameter of method
    BrokerFacade.readOperationalDataBehindMountPoint() to get data from
    datastore.
    
    If %2F are correctly replaced with / test is succesful.

    Resolve Bug:593. Persister should communicate via OSGi SR instead of TCP.
    
    Config persister now pushes configuration to netconf service directly by
    java calls instead of using TCP connection to localhost. This allows
    removing netconf client dependency from config-netconf-connector and
    removes confusion when running more than one ODL process with same
    configuration.

    Do not catch Throwables, but rather Exceptions
    
    This turns catch Throwable into catch Exception, as doing the former
    catches Errors, which are documented to be pretty much irrecoverable
    conditions. Looking at
    http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Error.html non of
    these call sites can recover from an Error happening, so they should
    never catch them.

    Resolve Bug:448 - Remove yang-store api and impl.
    
    Depends on yangtools commit https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/5579/ .
    Instead of having multiple bundle trackers for config and netconf, keep only
    one. Each bundle containing yang files should use sal code generator, which
    generates YangModuleInfo objects. Using this instead of speculatively having
    to parse all current yang files for each adding bundle event allows not having
    to deal with broken yang dependencies when bundle events come in wrong order.
    Put SchemaContextProvider to OSGi SR in config-manager, so that any bundle
    working with yang can use it. This replaces too specific YangStoreService which
    was coupled with yang-jmx-generator. Users can listen for changes directly
    on OSGi SR - they receive service changed event when yang module is added or
    removed.

    Stop config-manager as first bundle when shutting down container.
    
    If config-manager is stopped after a configured module's bundle has been stopped, config-manager will be unable to cleanly
    close other instances, so it needs to be stopped as first bundle.
    GlobalEventExecutorModule (netty-global-event-executor) is singleton, enforce it in only allowing one instance
    called 'singleton'.
    Make shutdown grace period smaller in order to close netty threads sooner that shutdown issues System.exit(1).

    Untangle the XML/Hello message decoders
    
    The tie between these classes was completely unnecessary -- we had this
    complicated contract just for the sake of reusing couple of lines of
    code. Untangle and optimize.

    Do not instantiate multiple DocumentBuilderFactories
    
    We're instantiating builders themsenves, so we can safely reuse a single
    factory. No sense in initiating it more than once.

    Split message aggregators
    
    This splits the EOM aggregator and the chunked encoding aggregator. The
    chunked encoding can be much more efficient and hardened as it allows
    for proper stream processing.
    
    We do not go the entire way here, just tighten the chunk header parsing
    by keeping an explicit state machine. We still need to gather the entire
    message before shifting it, as our downstream expects to see the message
    in its entirety.

    Cleanup framing mechanisms
    
    This gets rid of pre-instantiated NetconfMessageHeader in favor of
    creating a static constructor method.
    
    Furthermore allow our output chunking to be variable and bump the
    default from 1K to 8K. The upper limit on chunk size is 16M.

    2. Subscriber gets sream name as a response from server
    3. Subscriber calls GET operation on /streams/stream/<streamName>
    4. Subscriber gets response with status code 200 OK and header field Location contains URI of web socket server
    5. Subscriber creates web socket http connection to obtained URI in step 4.
    6. Subscriber can be unregistered from receiving notifications by sending CloseWebSocketFrame with reasonText containing stream name

    Refactor config-persister: clean up exception handling and netconf client.
    
    Split ConfigPersisterNotificationHandler into registrator and listener, remove unnecessary
    reference to NetconfClient.
    Refactor ConfigPusher: each method now returns computational results instead of void. Avoid
    unnecessary NetconfClient reference leak - close it after every use. Rename generic 'timeout'
    to 'maxWaitForCapabilitiesMillis'. Avoid throwing and catching SAXException and IOException
    as there is no recovery from them; keep only ConflictingVersionException.
    ConfigPersisterActivator now actually uses the configurable timeout, the property is renamed
    from 'pushTimeout' to 'maxWaitForCapabilitiesMillis'.

    Prevent ConfigPusher from killing its thread
    
    The original code promoted pretty much every error to an unhandled
    RuntimeException. Use the exceptions already in place to handle erros
    occuring. Also handle IO error as a retriable operation.

    Fix config transaction handling in netconf.
    
    When config manager fails a transaction because of optimistic lock failure, netconf
    must clean up this transaction as well. Fix TransactionProvider to abort transaction
    if commit fails. Only exception is ValidationException where user should
    have an option to fix the configuration and commit again.
    
    Turn off netconf client reuse in persister: this narrows the possibility of
    hitting concurrent modification with other config transactions. Each retry
    to push a snapshot is now done with a newly obtained client, so new transaction
    will be started each time.

    Changed mount point URI decoding in restconf
    
    - string "yang-ext:mount" in URI means mount point.
      After this string must be string in format moduleName:dataNode
      example:
      /rectconf/config/moduleName1:cont1/cont2/yang-ext:mount/moduleName2:cont3/cont4
         mount point path - moduleName1:cont1/cont2/
         path behind mount point - moduleName2:cont3/cont4
    
    - refactoring of POST, PUT, GET, DELETE tests for status codes
    - test for output of several modules to one xml and json file were added

    Add consistency check of visible yang modules to netconf.
    
    Netconf connector to config subsystem performs this check before a netconf session is established.
    This check consists of comparing yang modules visible to config subsystem to modules visibile to yangstore.
    If an inconsistency is detected, session negotiation is cancelled and the session is dropped.

    Refactor persister: Add ability to publish multiple snapshots while loading initial configuration.
    
    Persister adaptors now return list of snapshots to be pushed to netconf at server startup. Persister maintains an ordered list of adaptor
    instances, each with its configuration. During server startup it iterates the list backwards until non empty list of snapshot is returned.
    Each snapshot can depend on different capabilities, once all capabilities for given snapshot are announced by server, persister pushes this
    snapshot.

    Initial implementation of netconf monitoring module according to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6022
    
    Response from netconf GET operation now contains monitoring information about current netconf state.
    
    Modified netconf-impl module: added monitoring capabilities to netconf-impl module exposed as OSGi service.
    
    Added netconf-monitoring module that provides a filter for netconf GET operation
    and adds monitoring information retrieved from netconf-impl to the response of the GET operation.
    It implements netconf-mapping-api similar to config-netconf-connector and
    currently provides information about current netconf SESSIONS and yang SCHEMAS
    (these information is retrieved via the netconf monitoring OSGi service provided by netconf-impl).
    
    Added ietf-netconf-monitoring module that contains sources generated from ietf-netconf-monitoring yang.
    These sources serve as an interface between netconf-impl and netconf-monitoring.

    Config-manager commits a blank transaction each time new ModuleFactory is discovered. At the same time
    persister might try to push configuration. Add retries to both routines to overcome optimistic lock failure.

    Finding data nodes in choices and cases.
    
    Feature was rewritten. It is no more taken into account if schemas for data
    nodes at the same level are in the same case for concrete choice. This check should be done in system which takes Json as input

    Null data from XML
    
    In case of reading data from XMl to Composite node following rule was
    added:
    - XML with opening and closing tag without data is mapped to single node
      with empty string
      (e. g. <foo></foo> -> single node with empty string)
    - XML with only closing tag is mapped to single node with null value (e.
      g. <foo /> -> single node with null value)

    Union type processing added to JsonMapper
    
    if data type according to schema is union then data from single node are validated as follows:
    - if simple node value is null -> [null] is written to JSON
    - if simple node value is number and union yang contains one of number types ->
      number is written to JSON
    - if simple node value si true or false and union yang contains BooleanType ->
      true or false is written to JSON
    - other cases are written to JSON as string (inside "")

    Reduce logged messages during build and concentrate only on the ones
    needed for debugging build errors
    
    - Create a maven artifact that contains a default settings for
    logback.xml so it can be reused as dependency to make sure some
    plugins don't generate too much verbose output
    - Use the artifact
    org.opendaylight.controller:commons.logback_settings as UT dependency
    so to make sure only in case of errors the follow UT spit messages:
            + netconf-impl
            + config-netconf-connector
    - Remove duplicated logback.xml where not needed
    - Remove logback.xml and space_and_tabs_checks.xml where no longer needed
    - Added logback.xml as a file on the integration tests using pax-exam,
    there a local file seems to be required (unfortunately). Make sure the
    pax-exam uses it for the tests where not using it.
    - Made sure the sanitytest in distribution only runs when
    integrationstests profile is selected
    - Fixed an issue in importing in eclipse zeromq module
    - Excluded all tests from mdsal unless the integrationtests profile is
    selected

    NetconfClientDispatcher moved to constructor arguments in NetconfClient
    This way NioEventLoopGroup instance can be reused by multiple clients.
    
    Dispatcher created in NetconfCLient's constructor spawned an instance of NioEventLoopGroup (in AbstractDispatcher in bgpcep repo).
    Instance of NioEventLoopGroup spawns new threads and with multiple concurrent clients system could get out of resources e.g. Too many open files, Unable to create new native thread.

    Updated RESTCONF implementation
    
      - Restconf implementation now implements new SAL readign contracts
        in form of <String,CompositeNode> where String is Restconf version
        of instance identifier.
    
        Translation of Restconf InstanceIdentifier into Binding-Independent
        Restconf Instance-Identifier is done by ControllerContext class
        which implements stateful translation of identifier based on schema
        context.
    
        After translation of instence-identifier most of actions maps
        directly to Binding-Independent APIs.

    Initial code drop of netconf protocol implementation
    
    This implementation is based on infrastructure provided by the framework artifact
    and contains server as well as client side code.
    
    Netconf subsystem structure:
    Netconf-api:
    Api definition for client and server.
    
    Netconf-impl:
    Netconf server implementation. Server handles basic communication
    and delegates handling of rpcs to an implementation of netconf-mapping-api.
    
    Netconf-mapping-api:
    Api definition for pluggable rpcs handler. Implementations of this api
    are plugged dynamically into netconf-impl using OSGi apis.
    
    Config-netconf-connector:
    Implementation of netconf-mapping-api that handles netconf rpcs and delegates
    requests to configuration subsystem
    
    Netconf-util:
    Utility classes used by client and server code.
    
    Netconf-client:
    Netconf client implementation.
    
    Netconf-it:
    Integration tests for netconf. These tests verify correct cooperation of netconf server,
    config-netconf-connector, config subsystem and netconf client.
    
    Config-persister-api:
    Api definition for config persister. Config persister is a component that is responsible
    for storing configuration snapshots after every change to the configuration via netconf rpcs.
    (Pushed to config-subsystem)
    
    Config-persister-impl:
    Implementation of config persister that receives notifications from netconf-impl about changes
    to the configuration and uses pluggable adapters to store received snapshots.
    
    Config-persister-file-adapter:
    Implementation of config persister adapter that stores and restores config snapshots from a file.
    (Pushed to config-subsystem)
    
    In order to run netconf in OSGi, some configuration issues had to be resolved
    in config-subsystem bundles.
